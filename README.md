# ISYE_6644_Distribution_Fitting
Make me a nice library of routines for fitting input distributions using maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). Distributions: Bern(p), Geom(p), Exp(λ), Normal(μ, σ2), Gamma(α, β), Weibull(α, β), etc. Run examples and conduct χ2 goodness-of-fit tests to show how well the fits do.
